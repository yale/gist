  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  Definitious ("Definitious", "we" or "us") collects (a) the
  e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, (b) aggregate
  information concerning what pages users access or visit, and (c) information
  volunteered by the user (such as survey information and/or site
  registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of
  our Website and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to
  other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or
  services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the
  following circumstances:
</p>
<ol>

	  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
	  of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
	</li>
	<li>
	  We transfer information about you if Definitious is acquired by or
	  merged with another company. In this event, Definitious will notify you
	  before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
	  privacy policy.
	</li>
	<li>
	  We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole
	  purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When

	  such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy
	  Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
	</li>
	<li>
	  We provide such information to third parties who have entered into
	  non-disclosure agreements with us.
	</li>

  <h1>Information Gathering and Usage</h1>
</p>

<p>
  When you submit a posting to Definitious we ask for information such as
  your email address and name. Definitious uses collected information for
  the following general purposes: products and services provision,
  identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and
  research.
</p>
<p>
  <h1>Cookies and Web Beacons</h1>
</p>
<p>
  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique
  identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and
  stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required to use some Definitious
  services. Definitious and its ad management partners ("Ad Partners") use cookies to record current session information. You
  are required to login to your Definitious editor account after a certain
  period of time has elapsed in order to verify your use of the account and
  protect you against others inadvertently accessing your account.
</p>
<p>
Our Ad Partners may also from time to time use web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons are provided by our Ad Partners and allow Ad Partners to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page and the information in cookies set by the Ad Partners. Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Website. 

</p>
<p>
With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. 
</p>
<p>
  <h1>Data Storage</h1>
</p>
<p>
  Definitious uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
  necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology
  required to run Definitious. Definitious owns the code, databases,
  and all rights to the Definitious application.
</p>
<p>
  <h1>Security</h1>

</p>
<p>
  We take precautions to ensure the security of your personal information.
  However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel may gain
  access to your personal information despite our efforts. You should note that
  in using the Definitious service, your information will travel through
  third party infrastructures which are not under our control.
</p>
<p>
  We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that
  you transmit to other users. You should never transmit personal or identifying
  information to other users.
</p>
<p>
  <h1>Children</h1>
</p>
<p>
  The Definitious service is not intended for children under 13, and we do
  not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

</p>
<p>
  Children aged 13 or older should not submit any personal information without
  the permission of their parents or guardians. By using the Definitious
  service, you are representing that you are at least 18, or that you are at
  least 13 years old and have your parents' or guardians' permission to use the
  service.
</p>
<p>
  <h1>Changes</h1>
</p>
<p>
  Definitious may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about
  significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a
  notice to the email address specified in your Definitious editor account
  and by placing a prominent notice on our site.
